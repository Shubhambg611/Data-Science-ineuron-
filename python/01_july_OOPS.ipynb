    "Q1 .What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- he primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design software in a way that reflects the real-world entities and their interactions. OOP is centered around the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes. A class is a blueprint that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) \n",
    "1. Encapsulation: This involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary for the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: This allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class (base class or superclass). Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ans:- In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and the functions that operate on that data. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, and you can think of them as templates or molds for creating instances of objects."

    "Ans.\n",
    "1. Attributes: \n",
    "* Attributes are variables that store data associated with a class and its instances (objects).\n",
    "* They represent the characteristics or properties of an object.\n",
    "* Attributes are defined in the class and are accessed using dot notation with instances of the class.\n",
    "* In Python, attributes are typically initialized in the special method __init__ (the constructor) or can be added dynamically.\n",
    "2. Methods:\n",
    "* Methods are functions defined within a class, and they define the behavior of the class and its instances.\n",
    "* They operate on the data (attributes) of the class and can perform actions or computations.\n",
    "* Methods are called on instances of the class and can access and manipulate the object's attributes using self.\n",

    "Ans. \n",
    "1. Class Variables:\n",
    "* Class variables are shared among all instances (objects) of a class.\n",
    "* They are defined outside of any method in the class and are typically placed at the top of the class definition.\n",
    "* Class variables are accessed using the class name rather than the instance name.\n",
    "* They are useful for storing data that is shared by all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instance Variables:\n",
    "* Instance variables are specific to each instance of the class.\n",
    "* They are defined within methods, typically in the __init__ method (constructor), and are prefixed     with self to associate them with the instance.\n",
    "* Each instance of the class can have different values for instance variables.\n",
    "* Instance variables represent the unique characteristics or state of each object."

    "\n",
    "Ans. the self parameter in class methods serves as a reference to the instance of the class. It is a convention, and the name self is not mandatory (you could use any name, but self is widely accepted and recommended). The purpose of self is to allow access to the instance's attributes and methods within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a method on an instance of a class, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to that method. By convention, this first parameter is named self. It provides a way for the method to refer to and manipulate the attributes and methods of the instance."
