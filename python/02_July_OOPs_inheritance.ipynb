    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the \"subclass\" or \"derived class\") to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called the \"superclass\" or \"base class\").

The relationship between the subclass and superclass is often referred to as an \"is-a\" relationship, indicating that an object of the subclass is a specialized type of object of the superclass."

    "\n",
    "Ans. In object-oriented programming, access modifiers are keywords that define the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields, methods, nested classes) within a class hierarchy. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP, and access modifiers play a crucial role in determining how members of a class are inherited by its subclasses. The three main access modifiers are \"public,\" \"protected,\" and \"private.\"\n",

    "Ans. The super keyword in object-oriented programming languages, such as Java and Python, is used to refer to the superclass or parent class. It is often used within a subclass to call methods, access fields, or invoke the constructor of the superclass. The primary purpose of super is to facilitate the reuse of code and provide a way to extend the functionality of the superclass in the subclass."
